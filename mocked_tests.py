# Each test should extend unittest.TestCase and use the mocking framework in Lecture 13
# Each test should test logic of 1 unique function in your app. None should make any real DB/Socket calls, but instead mock them
# Each test should have 3+ test params (inputs) and 2+ assert statements, and pass when ran
